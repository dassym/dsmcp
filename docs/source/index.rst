dsmcp applications
******************

The `dsmcp` package provides a family of human-machine interface applications for Dassym electronic boards.

These interfaces can be command line (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI).

These applications can connect to the electronic board in 2 ways:

- **direct** through a serial interface (RS-232)
- **remotely** via a *proxi* and the *dsm-scp* client application.
