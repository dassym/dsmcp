Description: # dsmcp
        
        The DSMCP program is a Python implementation of a control panel for Dassym engines.
        DSMCP can be used to control motors by connecting a Dassym electronic card (MB-x) to the PC via an RS-232 link.
        DSM is based on the PyDapi2 library.
        
        DSMCP can work with a graphical user interface (GUI) or simply with the command line (CLI).
        
        It is possible to trace all the messages exchanged with the card.
        
        This program was created for the internal needs of Dassym. 
        It is distributed to help our partners in their projects to integrate our products into their own solutions.
